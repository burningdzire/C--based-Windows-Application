Abstract

Few months ago we thought of building an animation project for our even semester minor project and we came up with an idea that it would be cool to have a fully functional animated creature on the window screen which can interact with the user through its actions. We fiddled around with it and here we are presenting to you the animated creature we have been working on for a couple of months.

We started thinking about the developers' state of mind when they created Animated Assistants. Did they think it would really help people? It seems that Microsoft really believed that Assistants were the way of the future.

We built Dino in the last couple of months to share that fun and whimsy with everyone, and to remind people to try new and risky things, even when they seem silly.
